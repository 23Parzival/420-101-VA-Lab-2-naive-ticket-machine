### Answers to questions of part II.

# Part II:

2. The value of balance is now zero.

3. If too much money is inserted, the balance is returned to zero without 
   without giving the moey back. When too little is inserted, the ticket is 
   printed nontheless. If there is zero money in the balance, the ticket is 
   printed anyway.

5. The price printed on the ticket is different.

6. `public class LabClass` and `public class Student`

7. Yes, public is the visibility, class declares that it is a class. The class
   has red lines all over it. It says, "<identifier> expected", this explains
   what is wrong to someone who knows what should be there but to a beginner
   it is slightly unspecific.
   
10. public class TicketMachine
    public TicketMachine(int cost)
    price = cost;
    balance = 0;
    total = 0;
    public int getPrice()
    return price;
    public int getBalance()
    public void insertMoney(int amount)
    public void printTicket()
    
11. It does not have a class identifier and 
    it contains parameters`(int cost)`.
